## About Site
This is a website for the fictional organisation, EGO (or Team Ghost) from the popular battle Royale game [fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite). I used [Gamepedia](https://fortnite.gamepedia.com/E.G.O.), [GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-ego-alter-who-are-they/), and the endless hours that I've spent playing the game as my sources for the content.

## Design
I chose to stick to the default Bootstrap look as much as possible. I used multiple Bootstrap Components, including buttons, the navigation menu, and more. It should be noted that I copied and edited some of these components straight from the Bootstrap website, but edited them. I wrote my own CSS, structured the site, and more. 

## File Stucture
The website has a conventional structure, featuring html files in the root folder, css files in a css folder,images in an image folder and the JS file in a JS folder. It is made up of 4 html files, 1 CSS file, 1 SCSS file, and 1 JavaScript file. It also has 5 image files. The text files are:

1. index.html: This is the homepage of the website
2. team.html: This contains a table with team members of the Ghost organisation
3. locations.html: This covers some of the Ghost locations inside the game.
4. Resources.html: This features a list of multiple fortnite resources online
