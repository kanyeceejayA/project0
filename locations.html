                    <p>
                        The Agency is the Head Office of Ghost. It is located inside the coordinates D4, E4 and E5, at the direct center of the map, east of Salty Springs, south of Risky Reels northeast of Weeping Woods and southwest of Frenzy Farm. It is an Agency run by Ghost, previously known as E.G.O.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Midas patrols the area with his Mythic Drum Gun. Henchmen, cameras, and sentry turrets are also located throughout The Agency. It has a Helicopter and the best-stocked safe.

                    <p>
                        The Yacht is Midas' Boat. It is located inside the coordinate H1, north of Steamy Stacks and very far east of Craggy Cliffs. As the name implies, it is a giant yacht. The Reboot Van here is located on an island just next to the location. Deadpool patrols the area with his Mythic Hand Cannons. Before Deadpool took over the location, it was patrolled by Meowscles.

                        Meowscles crossed over to the dark side when Deadpool arrived, and now stays elsewhere.

                    <p>
                        The Shark is an island mansion-turned-prison. It is located inside the coordinate B1, far north of Sweaty Sands and northwest of Pleasant Park, in the top leftmost corner of the map. It is an island with a large prison owned by Ghost with a rock formation in the outline of a shark. Skye patrols the area with her Mythic Assault Rifle and her Mythic Grappler, which are both dropped upon her death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the 12.40 update, The Shark used to be a modern house. It was also unaffiliated, having neither Ghost nor Shadow henchmen. Midas has it transformed into a prison that shall be used soon.
